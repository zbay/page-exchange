Page Exchange Version 1.0

https://page-exchange.herokuapp.com/

This site was made to fulfill the requirements of a FreeCodeCamp project (http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/manage-a-book-trading-club).

Built with Node and Express, this site allows users to post books and manage trades with other users. Lacking the ability to enforce trades, it trusts users to get into contact via email to fulfill them.
